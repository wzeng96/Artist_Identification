# Author Identification of Works of Art: Convolutional Neural Networks Modeling
### Capstone Project
### The George Washington University

Welcome! This project is about identifying artist based on a piece of artwork, with no other information given. The three main methods are Random Forest Classifier, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Residual Network 50 (ResNet 50). By comparing the accuracy scores of the three models, we would choose the most optimal model for future uses.
